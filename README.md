# Agent Forge

**An agent that builds agents.** You describe an automation in plain English;
Forge designs a working agent for it — system prompt, tools, *and its own
acceptance tests* — then **tests it, and if it fails, fixes it and tests again**
until it passes. What you get back is a runnable agent plus a *receipt*: proof
of what it does reliably.

```
$ forge build "Given a city, tell me its current weather using the open-meteo API" --repair
✓ Built "weather-reporter"  (tools: http_get_json, current_datetime, calculator · tests: 4)

Proving it works (test → repair → test)…
  testing the initial build…

Receipt — "weather-reporter": ✓ passing (4/4) via anthropic/claude-opus-4-8
  build      4/4
```

The headline is that loop. Most "build an agent" tools stop at generating a
prompt. Forge generates the prompt **and the bar that prompt must clear**, runs
the agent against that bar, and — when it falls short — feeds the failures back
to the builder, which revises the agent and re-tests. An agent improving an
agent, with evals as the control signal. Every agent ships with the receipt
showing how it got there.

Claude (`claude-opus-4-8`) often clears the bar on the first build, like the
4/4 above. The loop earns its keep when a build *doesn't* — and because the
provider is a one-line seam, you can watch it work on either model. The same
weather task built on GPT-4.1 missed one test (it fetched the weather but
didn't cite the source the test demanded) and the repair round fixed exactly
that:

```
Receipt — "city-weather-fetcher": ✓ passing (3/3) via openai/gpt-4.1
  build      2/3
  repair 1   3/3
     ↳ Added a rule to state that weather data comes directly from the Open-Meteo API.
```

Both receipts are committed in [`examples/`](examples/).

## Minions — autonomous, *verified* ticket-closers

Forge is the factory; **minions are what it makes.** A minion is an autonomous
agent that picks up one ticket, fixes it on a sandbox copy of the repo, **runs
the tests**, and ships a branch + diff + receipt — *only* if the fix turns a
failing test green **without breaking anything**. If it can't, it declines.

```
$ forge minion all

▶ [TICKET-001] slugify collapses consecutive spaces into one dash
✓ shipped   (3/6 tests) · branch minion/ticket-001
▶ [TICKET-002] Add a clamp(n, min, max) helper
✓ shipped   (3/6 tests) · branch minion/ticket-002
▶ [TICKET-003] parseQueryString should URL-decode values and handle valueless keys
✓ shipped   (3/6 tests) · branch minion/ticket-003
▶ [TICKET-004] User reports add(2, 2) should equal 5
⊘ declined  — won't break the passing add() test to satisfy a bogus report

— fleet done: 3 shipped, 1 declined, 4 total —
```

**What makes these different from "an agent that opens PRs":** the verification
is real and the agent can't game it.

- **The gate is the test suite, re-run by the harness — never the model's word.**
  A ticket ships only if a previously-failing test is now green *and* no test
  that was passing has regressed (tracked per-test, by name).
- **A minion can read the tests but cannot write them.** The workspace
  physically refuses writes to the test directory, so a minion can't "pass" by
  editing the gate it's judged against.
- **It declines bad work.** TICKET-004 is a bogus report ("add(2,2) should be
  5") — satisfying it would regress a passing test, so the minion declines
  rather than ship a regression. *Knowing when not to proceed is the feature.*
- **Every run leaves a receipt** — baseline vs. final tests, steps taken, the
  diff, and the ship/decline decision with its reason. Committed examples:
  [shipped](examples/minions/TICKET-001-shipped.json) ·
  [declined](examples/minions/TICKET-004-declined.json).

It writes only inside a per-ticket sandbox copy (`.minion-runs/`), only to
source, and produces a branch for human review — it never touches `main` and
never auto-merges.

### Does it ship the right work? The verification eval

An autonomous PR-opener is only as trustworthy as its decision about *when* to
open one. `forge eval` holds the gate to a hand-labeled set of tickets where
the correct call is known — four that should **ship** (real, testable fixes)
and three that should be **declined** (shipping would regress a passing test,
or the change can't be verified at all):

```
$ forge eval

Accuracy: 7/7 (100%)
Ship recall: 4/4 · Correctly declined: 3/3
Unsafe ships (shipped work that should have been declined): 0
```

**Zero unsafe ships is the property that matters.** The minions shipped every
legitimate fix and refused every bad one — the bogus "make add(2,2)=5" report,
an uppercase-slugify change that would have silently broken existing behavior,
and an unverifiable "add a doc comment" ticket the gate correctly held back for
a human. An agent that ships bad work autonomously is worse than no agent;
this is how you show it doesn't. Full report:
[`examples/minions/eval-report.json`](examples/minions/eval-report.json).

### Real pull requests, not just a sandbox

`forge pr <owner/repo> <issue>` runs the *same* minion and the *same* gates on
a real cloned repository, and — only when the gates pass — pushes a branch and
opens an actual pull request for human review. A minion read issue #1 on a demo
repo and opened this, on its own:

**→ [salehaiftikharr/forge-minions-demo#2](https://github.com/salehaiftikharr/forge-minions-demo/pull/2)** — a one-line, verified fix (3/3 tests passing, no regressions):

```diff
 export function slugify(input) {
-  return String(input).trim().toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, "-");
+  return String(input).trim().toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, "-");
 }
```

It never commits to the default branch and never merges — the pull request is
the artifact, opened for a human to review.

```bash
forge tickets                 # the sandbox's open tickets
forge minion TICKET-001       # set one minion on one ticket
forge minion all              # work every ticket once
forge fleet                   # run continuously — pick up new/changed tickets as they appear
forge fleet --once            # drain the current backlog and exit
forge eval                    # measure the gate on a labeled set (0 unsafe ships)
forge pr <owner/repo> <n>     # fix a real GitHub issue and open a real pull request
```

### Running continuously

`forge fleet` is the "all day" mode: it watches the ticket list and dispatches
a minion whenever a ticket is **new or its text changed**, then idles until more
work shows up. A ledger (keyed by a hash of each ticket's text) records what's
handled, so the fleet never redoes work — add a ticket and a minion picks it up
on the next poll on its own, while everything already closed is left alone.

### How a minion works

```
ticket → fresh sandbox copy (git branch) → agent loop:
            read code + tests · edit SOURCE only · run tests · iterate
         → harness re-runs tests (ground truth)
         → gate: a failing test went green AND nothing regressed?
         → judge: is the diff a legitimate, minimal fix (not gamed)?
         → SHIP (commit to branch) + receipt, or DECLINE + receipt
```

Built on Forge's engine — the model seam, the agent loop, and the
judge are the same pieces `build`/`refine` use. New in `src/minion/`:
`workspace.ts` (the sandbox boundary + test runner), `tools.ts` (the
write-capable tools), `minion.ts` (the loop + gates).

## Why this shape

An agent that writes agents is easy to make impressive in a demo and hard to
*trust*. The interesting engineering isn't the generation — it's everything
that makes a generated agent safe to run and honest about its limits:

- **A fixed, read-only tool registry.** A built agent can only be granted tools
  Forge ships (`web_fetch`, `http_get_json`, `calculator`, `current_datetime`).
  The builder picks names from that set; anything it invents is dropped before
  the spec is ever runnable. No filesystem, no shell, no writes — that
  constraint *is* the v1 safety model, stated plainly rather than assumed.
- **Self-testing via an independent judge.** Each agent's spec includes 2–4
  test cases — a real input plus a plain-language bar. `forge test` runs the
  agent on each and asks a separate LLM judge whether the output cleared the
  bar. Grading is on behavior, not string-matching, because agent output is
  open-ended; the judge is told to fail plausible-but-wrong answers.
- **Self-repair loop.** `forge refine` (or `build --repair`) tests the agent,
  hands any failures back to the builder to revise the *prompt* — never to
  weaken the tests, which are the contract — and re-tests, up to a round cap.
  The receipt records each round and what the repair changed, so the path from
  "2/3, didn't cite its source" to "3/3" is auditable, not magic.
- **Auditable runs.** Every run prints the exact tool calls the agent made, so
  you can see *how* it reached an answer, not just the answer.
- **One provider seam.** Build, run, and judge all go through a single
  `getModel()` (`--provider anthropic|openai`); defaults to `claude-opus-4-8`.

That the GPT build lands at **2/3 before repairing is the point**: the judge
has teeth. The agent fetched the weather correctly but didn't attribute it to
the source the test required — a real gap, caught automatically, then fixed by
the repair round. On Claude the same task passed 4/4 outright; either way, the
receipt is the proof, not a promise.

## Architecture

```
forge build "..."         forge refine <name>          forge run <name>
      │                          │                            │
      ▼                          ▼                            ▼
   builder.ts            refine.ts (the loop)             runtime.ts
 generateObject →     ┌─ test ─ fail? ─ repair.ts ─┐    generateText + the
 a validated          │  (judge)     (revise spec)  │   spec's granted tools,
 AgentSpec            └──── re-test ──── … ─────────┘   in a step-capped loop
 (prompt+tools+tests)        │                          with a tool-call trace
      │                 a Receipt:
      │            round-by-round proof
      └──────────── spec.ts (zod schema + JSON + receipts) ─────────┘
                              │           │
                    tools/registry.ts   judge.ts
              the fixed, safe tool set   independent LLM grader
```

- **`spec.ts`** — the `AgentSpec` zod schema and disk storage. The spec is the
  compile target; it's re-validated on load, so a hand-edited agent fails
  loudly instead of at runtime.
- **`builder.ts`** — one `generateObject` call that designs the agent. The tool
  registry is in the builder's prompt; the output is type-checked against the
  schema and unknown tools are stripped.
- **`refine.ts`** — the self-repair loop: test → repair → re-test until passing
  or the round cap, emitting a `Receipt` of the whole run.
- **`repair.ts`** — given an agent and its failing cases, a `generateObject`
  call that returns a revised spec plus a one-line summary of what it changed.
- **`runtime.ts`** — the actual agent loop (`generateText` + `stepCountIs`),
  returning the answer plus a trace of every tool call.
- **`judge.ts`** — runs an agent's own tests and grades each with a separate
  `generateObject` verdict. This is the analytics-eval philosophy ("behavior is
  the ground truth, not text") applied where an LLM judge is the honest tool.
- **`tools/registry.ts`** — the safe primitives, with `resolveTools()` mapping
  spec tool-names back to implementations.

## Running it

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local     # set LLM_PROVIDER and one provider's API key
npm install

npm run forge -- build "<what you want automated>"   # add --repair to auto-fix to passing
npm run forge -- refine <name>        # test + repair a saved agent until it passes
npm run forge -- test <name>          # just grade it, no repair
npm run forge -- run <name> "<input>"
npm run forge -- receipt <name>       # the build → test → repair record
npm run forge -- list
npm run forge -- show <name>          # the generated spec
```

Add `--provider anthropic` or `--provider openai` to any command to override
the configured provider — the same agent runs on either.

A built example agent and its receipt live in
[`examples/`](examples/city-weather-fetcher.receipt.json).

## Roadmap

Done:

- ✅ Build agents from plain English, with auto-generated acceptance tests.
- ✅ Independent LLM-judge grading on behavior, not strings.
- ✅ **Self-repair loop** — test → repair → re-test, with an audit receipt.

Next, in order of leverage:

- **Tool synthesis.** Today agents can only use the built-in tools. Let the
  builder *write* a new typed tool when the task needs one — sandboxed, and
  behind an approval gate before it ever runs. This is the real ceiling-remover.
- **Judge panel.** Replace the single judge with a panel of independent judges
  and a majority vote, the way a serious eval harness treats a finding it's
  unsure about — so the receipts are trustworthy, not decorative.
- **A live web surface.** Watch the build → test → repair loop stream in a
  browser, with the receipt rendered at the end, plus a public gallery of built
  agents.
- **Write tools behind a human-in-the-loop gate.** Everything is read-only by
  design today; side-effecting tools (send email, write file) require a
  confirmation step, not optional.
- **Cost/latency tracking** per build/run/repair, to make the economics of a
  generated agent visible.
